## Introduction
A project where a 2D game was created using the [Pygame library](https://www.pygame.org/docs/). Pygame is a Python game library that provides access to video and sound hardware, as well as resources for creating 2D games.

In the repository, the source code files are organized into folders according to their functionality, such as folders for images, sounds, text fonts, game logic, among others. Additionally, there is a main file that is responsible for calling all other parts of the game.

## The game
The game itself is a platform game where the player controls a character and must overcome obstacles and enemies in order to go as far as possible, accumulating points.

The code was written in a modular way, making it easier to maintain and add new features. The code is well-commented and documented, which helps with understanding and learning for those interested in studying the project. The project was developed following the step-by-step instructions of the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk&ab_channel=ClearCode) from the ClearCode channel.


## Summary
In summary, the repository is a complete and well-organized project of a 2D game in Python, using the Pygame library, which can be used as a basis for other games or as a reference for programming students interested in games in Python.
